# BIGBANG
This project generates an array of numbers to predict when the Big Bang will happen based on divisible rules for arrays of 1 to 100.

## Rules
- Replace numbers divisible by **3** with the word **"BIG"**.  
- Replace numbers divisible by **5** with the word **"BANG"**.  
- Replace numbers divisible by both **3 and 5** with **"BIGBANG"**.  

> **Note:**  
> Divisible means the number can be divided by another and leaves no remainder.  
> Examples:  
> - 3 is divisible by 3.  
> - 5 is divisible by 5.  
> - 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5.
